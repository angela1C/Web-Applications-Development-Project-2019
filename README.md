# Web Application Development Project files

This repository contains a collection of files for the Web Application Development project submitted as part of the requirement for the Web Application Development module at GMIT as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics programme.

- Several HTML files for each page of the website including `index.html`.
- A `css` subfolder containing the CSS stylesheet used to style the HTML pages.
- An `img` subfolder containing images in `jpg` and `png` format used in the Website.
